    <h2>Game Concept</h2>
    <p>You’re stranded on a small desert island and must scavenge for food like coconuts and fruit to survive. Over time, you can craft tools, such as a spear to catch fish in shallow waters. After your first night, eerie noises lead you to a nearby cave filled with monsters. To defend yourself, you craft a simple knife and begin fighting the cave-dwelling creatures</p> 
    <p>As you progress, you unlock new tools and skills, culminating in defeating the cave’s final boss. This creature becomes your pet after earning its favor by giving it its favorite treat—a fish. In return, it rewards you with a crafting recipe for a simple boat.</p>
    <p>Using the boat, you can sail to the next island. However, the first boat has a 50% chance of breaking after each trip, requiring you to rebuild it if it fails. On the second island, you gain access to more materials, crafting recipes, foods, and monsters. With each new boat you craft, the success rate of your journeys improves, allowing safer exploration between islands.</p>
    <p>This pattern continues as you reach subsequent islands, each offering unique challenges and resources. By the time you craft a sturdy final boat, you can freely travel between all islands, fully unlocking the world and its possibilities.</p>

    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <p>This section outlines the development of the game:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GameMaker Studio:</strong> I chose GameMaker Studio for its flexibility and scalability, making it an ideal platform for both beginners and advanced users. While other applications like RPG Maker offered simplicity, they lacked the advanced customization I needed for my project, especially as it evolves.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Learning GML (GameMaker Language) presented a learning curve, but it was an enjoyable challenge that allowed me to continually enhance the game’s functionality. Additionally, creating original assets for the game’s maps, rather than relying on pre-made options, was a time-intensive process. However, this effort ensured the game’s visual elements were entirely unique and tailored to my vision.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools Used:</strong> This project provided an opportunity to strengthen my coding skills through GML and develop proficiency in working with custom-designed assets in various pixel art applications, enhancing both technical and creative competencies.</li>
    </ul>
