    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Erin Zielke, and I'm passionate about technology, problem-solving, and creative design. With a background in Computer Information Systems and a focus on tech support, I thrive in environments where I can blend my technical skills with my love for learning and helping others.</p>
    <p>I’ve had the opportunity to manage projects both professionally and personally, from supporting a variety of tech systems to developing a small game as part of a personal project. I’ve always enjoyed combining analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, whether it’s through writing complex code or crafting engaging user experiences.</p>
    <p>In my professional journey, I’ve worked on projects like building a student management system and contributing to my freelance portfolio in video editing and online business management. I've always embraced new challenges and aim to make meaningful contributions, whether in the workplace or through my own ventures.</p>
    <p>As a family-oriented person, I’m also interested in exploring life beyond the U.S. and have recently been looking into opportunities in countries that offer a high quality of life, liberal values, and a sense of community. I love how tech and global perspectives can intersect, and I’m constantly exploring ways to grow both professionally and personally.</p>
    <p>When I’m not working on a project or honing my skills you’ll find me exploring new ways to integrate technology with everyday life. Whether it's through freelance projects, diving into data analysis, or collaborating with others, I’m always looking for exciting opportunities to make a real impact.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting my site, and I hope we can connect soon!</p>
